# Please do not specify a dependency more precisely than needed. If version "1" works, do
# not specify "1.1.42". This reduces the number of total dependencies, as if you specify
# 1.1.42 and someone else who only needed "1" also specified 1.1.37, we end up having same
# dependency compined twice.
#
# In future we may discover that our code does not indeed work with "1", say it ony works
# for 1.1 onwards, or 1.1.25 onwards, in which case use >= 1.1.25 etc. Saying our code
# only works for 1.1.42 and not 1.1.41 nor 1.1.43 is really weird, and most likely wrong.
#
# If you are not using the latest version intentionally, please do not list it in this section
# and create it's own [dependencies.<name>] section, and document it with why are you not
# using the latest dependency, and what is the plan.

# and we are using 5, which means we have two sytnax highlighting libraries.
#
# Further, in future we have to manipulate the markup at AST level, instead of using the
# to_string() interface. https://fpm.dev/journal/#markdown-styling. So in the meanwhile
# we are disabling their conflicting syntect implementation.
