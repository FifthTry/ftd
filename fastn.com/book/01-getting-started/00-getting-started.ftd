Welcome to your journey to programming! In this chapter I will explains how to
install `fastn`, how to write a "hello world" program, how to publish it on
the web.

While we are learning programming from scratch, we would be learning best

use proper programming editor, and we will store our source code in a version
control system and finally we will deploy the hello world program on the web for
others to view.
