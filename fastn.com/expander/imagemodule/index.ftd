Hi, I am Ajit, welcome to fastn video series, fastn helps you build website
and web apps faster.




-- ds.h1: Supported Image Formats

`fastn` supports bunch of image file formats, checkout
[supported-image-formats](/built-in-types/#supported-image-formats)
to read about it. The link is shared in the description.



-- ds.h1: What are documents?


All the files with `.ftd` extensions in your package are called `documents`.
`FASTN.ftd` and `index.ftd` documents makes for a complete package.
But a package can have `n` number of other documents as well.


-- ds.h1: Rendering image in the browser

In this package, I have put all the images in the folder called `images`.

Now to add these images to the documents, we need to import the assets of this
package.


-- ds.h2: What is `assets`?

Every package has `assets` as a foreign variable provided by `fastn` and this
variable can be used to access the images or other files in the package.

-- ds.code:
lang: ftd

\-- import: <package-name>/assets

-- ds.h2: Section `ftd.image`

Now we can display the image by using the component `ftd.image` and passing the
file path in `src`. So we will write:


-- ds.code:
lang: ftd

\-- ftd.image:
src: $assets.files.images.<image-file-name-with-extension>

-- ds.markdown:
if: { source == "planning" }

After colon we start with `$`. $ is used for reference, then assets.

-- ds.markdown:
if: { source == "default" || source == "build" }

After colon we start with `$`. $ is used for reference to assets.

-- ds.markdown:

`files` here is used to access the files present in the package.

And anything after `files`, it is the path to the file.

`ftd.image` does not take any body so to avoid throwing error, so we will
wrap this text in the markdown component provided by doc-site.

-- ds.markdown:
if: { source == "planning" }

Now, we can display this in the browser. Let's save the file and refresh the
browser.

The image is added.

-- ds.image:
if: { source == "default" || source == "build" }
src: $fastn-assets.files.expander.imagemodule.adding-image.gif


-- ds.h3: Properties to image

We can apply various properties to this image, like
`width`, border, shadow, etc.

-- ds.markdown:
if: { source == "planning" }

So, if we give width as fill-container, the image will take the width of the
container.

-- ds.markdown:

If you have watched the video where I have explained how to round the corners
by using the border-property, [border-radius](/rounded-border/), you know that
we can apply it to image also.
If not, you can checkout out that video as well. You can find the link in
description.

-- ds.markdown:
if: { source == "planning" }

Let's say if we add another folder, and put this home.png inside it. Then we
need to change the path as

-- ds.code:
lang: ftd
if: { source == "planning" }

\-- ftd.image:
src: $assets.files.images.temp.home.png

-- ds.markdown:
if: { source == "default" || source == "build" }

Let's say if we add another folder `temp` inside the images folder, and put
this image file we are using inside it. Then we need to change the path as

-- ds.code:
lang: ftd
if: { source == "default" || source == "build" }

\-- ftd.image:
src: $assets.files.images.temp.<image-file-name-with-extension>

-- ds.markdown:

We can use two separate images for light and dark mode. For that, we just need
to add the image with same file name followed by `-dark` at the same location.

Also, we can give URLs in the `src`. But it is recommended to download the
image and import it through assets.

-- ds.code:
lang: ftd

\-- ftd.image:
src: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/A_Beautiful_Scenery.jpg


-- ds.markdown:
if: { source == "planning" }

We will do the same for all the documents where we want to add images.

-- ds.markdown:

This way we can add images in our documents.
