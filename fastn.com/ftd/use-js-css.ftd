-- ds.page: Interoperability with JS/CSS

`fastn` provides support for JavaScript integration in various places.
Besides JS, fastn also supports the use of CSS from [external CSS](/external-css/)
files. Through these ways we can incorporate JavaScript/CSS in `fastn`:

- [**JS in function**](/js-in-function/): A JavaScript function can be called
  within a function

- [**Web component**](/web-component/): A custom web component, created using JavaScript (or other
    languages too, that compiles to JS) can be incorporated into `fastn`
    documentation.

- [External CSS](/external-css/): fastn allows the use of external CSS for styling
  fastn components.

This gives you flexibility of using JS/CSS in `fastn` module.
