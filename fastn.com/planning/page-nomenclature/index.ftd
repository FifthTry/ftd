-- ds.page: Anatomy of a Page: Nomenclature and Composition

The purpose of the nomenclature of a page is to establish a standardized and
consistent naming system. This naming system helps ensure clear communication
and understanding among team members when discussing and working on a project.

-- ds.h1: Breaking Down the Page: Three Paths to Composition

Every webpage we create can take on a distinct form. We've simplified the page
composition into three core layouts:

-- ds.h3: 1. Web Page with 2 Sidebars

A layout that balances content with supplementary information through two
sidebars, providing a comprehensive view.

(Show example/ wireframe)

-- ds.h3: 2. Web Page with 1 Sidebar

A focused layout featuring one sidebar for targeted content.

(Show example/ wireframe)

-- ds.h3: 3. Full-Width Web Page

A visually immersive layout that spans the entire page width.

-- ds.h1: Defining Sections

Within the canvas of a webpage, sections play a pivotal role. Each section
includes specific content, contributing to the overall narrative. There's a
plethora of section types, each with unique purpose and layout. These sections
will contain elements like headings, text, images, and more.


-- ds.h3: Flush and Width Properties

Each section is defined by two essential properties: flush and width.

The flush property determines the section's width concerning the page size.
When set to true, the section stretches from edge to edge, embracing the
full available width of the screen. When flush is set to false, it means that
the section will have a defined width and won't stretch to the full width of
the page. Instead, it will adhere to the values specified by the width property.

The width property refers to a fixed width of the section. Width can be
assigned values like `wide`, `narrow`, `half`, `flush`, `2/3`, and `1/3`.

For instance,

Flush: When width is set to flush, the section's content spans the entire width
of the screen.

Wide: A wide width occupies a substantial portion of the page's width, offering
more room for content without taking up the full width.

Half: A section set to half width occupies half of the screen's width.

1/3: A section set to 1/3 width occupies about one-third of the screen's width.

(Embed interactive element to show the different width values. Example:
sliders or toggles to allow readers to dynamically see how different
properties (flush, wide, half, narrow, etc.) affect the appearance of a section
on a page.)

-- ds.h3: Naming a section

The name of the section should simplify the identification process.

To distinguish different sections, we assign names based on the elements within
each section.

For instance, a section with a heading, image, and CTA, as well as a section
with only a heading and image, will carry distinct names. For instance, the
former can be labeled as `h1-with-image-and-1-cta`, and the latter can be
referred to as `h1-with-image`.

(Show examples of both sections)

In scenarios where sections share common elements but boast varying alignments
or orientations, we utilize a numerical prefix to establish distinct identities.

Here is a practical example:
Imagine two hero sections, each featuring 2 CTAs. In the first, the heading,
subtitle, and CTAs are aligned at the top of the section, followed by the
image. For the second, the hero section showcases the same elements but with a
distinct alignmentâ€”headings, subtitles, and CTAs are right-aligned, while the
image is positioned to the left. To facilitate clear identification, we
designate these sections as `hero-right-hug` and `hero-left-hug`
respectively. This approach ensures an intuitive and organized system for
referencing.

-- ds.page: The Section Grid

A section grid brings multiple sections together in a grid format.  These grids
act as the foundation for arranging multiple sections in a cohesive and
visually appealing manner, typically in a column arrangement.

Section grids can be organized in various ways:

One-column, two-column, three-column, one-third right column, one-third left
column, full-width column.

(Show Example for each type)

-- ds.page: Need Clarification

1) Naming a section grid
2) Is the above mentioned types of section grid correct? If not, is the one given below coorect?

Section grids can be organized in various ways: (Option 2)

1. Horizontal/ Column Arrangement: Sections are placed side by side, creating a seamless flow of content.

2. Vertical/ Row Arrangement: Sections stacked atop one another, guiding users through a logical progression of information.

3. Clustered Formation: A group of both horizontal and vertical sections.
