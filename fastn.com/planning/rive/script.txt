Hello and welcome to `fastn` videos series.
My name is Amit, I am the creator of `fastn`.
`fastn` helps you create websites with ease.

In today's video we are going to talk about Rive.

What is Rive?

Rive lets you create animations. Interactive animations.


Rive is like modern day Flash. But Better.

Its built on top of JS so it is already supported by every device out there.

And it supports mobile applications. You get native speed animations on iOS,
Android etc.

And all these run-times are open source.






























And there you go!

Creating and adding animations to your website has never been easier.

Looking forward to see what you build with these awesome technologies.
