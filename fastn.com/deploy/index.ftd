-- ds.page: Static Vs Dynamic

`fastn` can be deployed in two main modes, static and dynamic.

-- ds.h1: Static Mode

To use static mode you run `fastn build` command, and this command creates a
folder named `.build` in the `fastn` package root folder (which is the folder
that contains `FASTN.ftd` file). This folder contains HTML, CSS, JS, and image
files. This folder can be deployed on any static web server.

Static mode is a great idea for a lot of content heavy, and infrequently
changing sites.

-- ds.h2: Static Hosting Is Cheaper

A lot of static hosting providers provide free hosting for static content.
Static host means no dynamic computation, and so it is quite cheap to host.

You can checkout our guide on [Github Pages](/github-pages/) and
[Vercel](/vercel/), two of the popular options available to you. Both offer free
plans.

-- ds.h2: Static Hosting Is Harder To Hack

If you are using static hosting, lesser software is running on the server, and
therefore it is harder to hack. Wordpress is a common alternative to build
content heavy websites, and Wordpress is often hacked by bad players.

-- ds.h2: Static Sites Are Faster

Since static sites are rendered HTML, so the server can directly serve the HTML
files, making it much faster to serve.

-- ds.h1: Dynamic Mode

Static mode is great, but sometimes you want dynamic features. Maybe you want
to have authentication on your site. Or maybe you want to collect information
from the visitors or show them up to date information.

To deploy your `fastn` website in dynamic mode you have to deploy the `fastn`
binary itself. `fastn` can run on Linux, Windows and Mac so you have a lot of
choices for where to deploy it.
