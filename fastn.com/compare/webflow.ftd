-- ds.page-with-get-started-and-no-right-sidebar: fastn vs Webflow, Framer and Wix

Website builders like Wix, Webflow, Framer, and other WYSIWYG editors are not 
reliable in the long term. They operate on the 80-20 Pareto Principle, 
addressing 80% of use cases but leaving you uncertain about whether your 
crucial features fall within the remaining 20%. They pose the risk of having to 
migrate to another platform later on due to limitations like alterations to 
features you depend on, business closures, or pricing changes. But with `fastn`,
that isn't the case. Here is a quick glance.
