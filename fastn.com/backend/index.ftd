-- ds.page: Backend And `fastn`

Along with [building frontends](/frontend/) `fastn` can be used for
building dynamic websites as well. With features already built and planned
`fastn` aspires to be a full stack framework.

-- ds.h1: Integration With Existing Backend

If a backend APIs are already available, you can interact with them, and include
the API responses and create dynamic web pages. Checkout the [http
processor](/http/) about how to do this.

`fastn` also has support for `endpoint` definitions, which allows frontend code
to communicate with existing APIs without worrying about cross origin policies
and exposing a unified domain. Read about it in the [endpoint
guide](/endpoint/).

-- ds.h1: Dynamic URLs

`fastn` by default generates URLs of your webpages based on the file path, but
you can define dynamic URLs to create beautiful URLs independent of file
organisation, or to create documents that is served when any URLs matching some
pattern is accessed.

Read more about it in our [Dynamic URLs Guide](/dynamic-urls/).

-- ds.h1: HTTP Request Data

When rendering any `fastn document` you can use `request data processor` to
extract request data like URL, query parameter etc, and use it with your APIs
or queries.

Read more about [Request Data Processor](/request-data/).

-- ds.h1: SQLite Data

`fastn` can be used to query data from sqlite database to generate dynamic
websites.

Read more about our [package query processor](/package-query/).

-- ds.h1: Reading JSON

`fastn` can also read data in JSON files that are part of your package to help
you create data visualisation websites.

Read more about [reading JSON](/get-data/).
