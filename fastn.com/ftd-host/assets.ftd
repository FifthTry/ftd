-- ds.page: `assets`: A Special Module

The `fastn` package has a special module called `assets` importing which
provides access to the variable referring to files and fonts defined in the
package.

The file referring variables are [foreign variables](foreign-variable) while
fonts are simple variables.

Using `assets` we can:

- [Access files (including images)](/accessing-files/)

- [Access font variables](/accessing-fonts/)
