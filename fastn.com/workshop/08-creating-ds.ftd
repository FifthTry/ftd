-- ds.page: Creating `ds` file - `fastn` Hands-On Workshop

As you can see to apply the color-scheme and typography or theme to all the
pages, we need to import the same lines in each file and then apply the
properties to the `ds.page` component.

Instead we can create a special file `ds.ftd` and create a component `page`
which will wrap doc-site's page component.

All the imports will be added in the `ds.ftd` and all the properties are
applied to the `ds.page`. This way we can use the parent `page` component
that will apply the theme, color-scheme, typography across the website.
This is also good for website maintainability.

In future, if you opt to change the theme or cs or typo, you need to change in
`ds.ftd` and it will apply to entire website.
