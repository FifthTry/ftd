-- ds.h1: Opinionated Design System

fastn comes with integrated design system with pre-defined styles and
UI elements, enabling you to build your website quickly.

Every component within the fastn ecosystem adheres to this unified [design
system](/design-system/), ensuring a consistent look and feel across your
entire site. You don't have to specify colour or font of every UI element.

Additionally, every fastn component supports responsive design, dark mode, and
themability. This fosters the creation of interchangeable components, promoting
collaboration between teams.

Another advantage of our design system is components designed by one team can
seamlessly integrate with the work of another.

You can also build custom content components for recurring information, ensuring
a consistent user experience throughout your website. Learn how to
[build custom components using fastn](/expander/).


-- ds.h1: Unified Color and Typography

You can manage color palettes and typography centrally to save time and ensure
consistent usage across your website. We provide a range of
[color scheme](https://fastn.com/featured/cs/) and
[typography](https://fastn.com/featured/fonts/) packages that can be imported
with just a few lines of code, transforming your website's appearance
in an instant.


-- ds.h2: Color schemes

Create a fastn package defining a color scheme, then import one of the color
schemes for use as-is or [customize the colors](/modify-cs/) as needed.
You can also integrate [Figma tokens](/figma/) with fastn's color scheme or
create your scheme from [Figma Json](/figma-to-fastn-cs/).

-- ds.h2: Typography

Define a typography fastn package and import one of the typography styles or
create your own using Google Fonts and make a
[fastn font package](/create-font-package/) on GitHub. Export fastn
[typography to JSON](/typo-to-json/) or generate
[fastn code from any typography JSON](/typo-json-to-ftd/).

-- ds.h1: Separation of Content and Design

With fastn, you can modify content without being concerned about design
repercussions.  Unlike traditional website builders, where altering themes or
layouts can be arduous and require meticulous adjustments, fastn simplifies the
process. A single line of code lets you change themes, layouts, color schemes,
and typography, ensuring design consistency with ease. This separation of design
and content allows for quick adjustments while minimizing inconsistencies.
