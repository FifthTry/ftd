The team at FifthTry would love to host our second `fastn` meet-up at
91Springboard, Bannerghatta Road Unit(C3 Conference Room, 3rd Floor) on the
coming Friday.

In this meetup, we will cover everything about fastn by answering the following
questions:

- What [fastn](https://fastn.com/) is all about?
- Why did we think of building a new `fastn` language?
- What it takes to develop a framework and a language from the `fastn`
  development team?
- What we have been up to of late?

Also, you will hear from a few people who have learned and used
[`fastn language`](https://fastn.com/ftd/). They will share their experience,
and show what they have built.

There will be a hands-on session where you will learn
[fastn language](https://fastn.com/ftd/).

We will appreciate if you can share this meet-up with your team.


	-- ds.h3: What is `fastn`?
	
	`fastn` is a universal new-age web-development platform, consciously structured
	to have a low learning curve on par with Microsoft Excel basics. It has been
	built specifically to make workflows across design, development & deployment
	simple and consistent.
	
	`fastn` is powered by three important elements - an indigenous design system, a
	curated list of UI components / templates and a powerful tailor-made
	programming language - [fastn language](https://fastn.com/ftd/).
	
	
	-- ds.h3: `fastn` language
	
	`fastn` langauge is designed for everyone, not just programmers. It is a new
	open-source, front-end, programming language.
	
	[fastn langauge](https://fastn.com/ftd/) can be used for building UI and is
	optimised for content centric websites, like: home pages, marketing landing
	pages, documentation pages and so on. For non-programmers, learning `fastn`
	language for authoring websites takes a day or so.
	
	[fastn language](https://fastn.com/ftd/) can also be used as a general purpose
	UI language. A team in Kerala is using it right now to build a web3 application
	and itâ€™s coming along quite nicely (though there are still many paper cuts and
	partially implemented features that we do not yet recommend for general purpose
	JS replacement. These will be ironed out maybe in another month or two).
	
	Checkout our mini course - [Expander Crash Course](https://fastn.com/expander/)
	We have also built a full-stack framework on top of it:
	[fastn](https://github.com/fastn-stack/fastn).
	
	Join us to learn more!
