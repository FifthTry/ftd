-- e.box: What is `fastn`?

`fastn` is the innovative programming language for writing prose.
Say goodbye to the complexities of traditional programming languages
and hello to a simplified and intuitive experience.

`fastn` language is designed for human beings, not just
programmers, we have taken precautions like not
requiring quoting for strings, not relying on
indentation nor on braces that most programming
languages require.
